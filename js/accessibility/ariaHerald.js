/**
 * A static object used to send aria-live updates to a screen reader. These are alerts that are independent of user
 * focus. This will simply reference 'aria-live' elements in the HTML document and update their content. ARIA
 * attributes specify the behavior of timing for the alerts. The following HTML elements must be in the document
 *
 *    <p id="polite-1" aria-live="polite"></p>
 *    <p id="polite-2" aria-live="polite"></p>
 *    <p id="polite-3" aria-live="polite"></p>
 *    <p id="polite-4" aria-live="polite"></p>
 *
 * It was discovered that cycling through these alerts prevented a VoiceOver bug where alerts would interrupt each
 * other. Starting from the first element, content is set on each element in order and cycles through.
 *
 * It is a commonly known (but not specified) limitation that aria-live elements must exist in the document before
 * the page has finished loading  to work with screen readers. Screen readers do not add observers to aria-live
 * elements that are added to the document after page load. So these elements must exist in the document before the
 * `onload` event triggers.
 *
 * Many aria-live and related attributes were tested, but none were well supported or particularly useful for PhET sims,
 * see https://github.com/phetsims/chipper/issues/472.
 *
 * NOTE: ariaHerald needs to be initialized before use as a singleton.
 * As of this writing (Nov 2017) this initialization occurs in Sim.js. Therefore if something uses ariaHerald
 * before Sim.js has initialized this file, the result will be a silent no-op.
